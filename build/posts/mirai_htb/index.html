      <p>Someone told me Mirai is an easy machine, so I decided to try it out.</p>
<p>Sometimes do easy stuff, like you killed bots in CSGO </p>
<p>Mirai was a botnet that essentially tried to crack down on devices using default passwords. </p>
<p>Now all CTF writeup are very coherant, that is never the case with me (I should play more CTFs)
So, I will just write it like a not so easy to replicate guide so that all the fun is not lost. </p>
<h2>Running NMAP</h2>
<p>Run a nmap and find some ports (ssh,tcp,http)</p>
<p><img alt="alt text" src="/static/assets/mirai_htb_nmap.png" /></p>
<p>We do get a debian version, it is advisable to look if something wrong with it, but the path integral of thoughts of my brain is inclined to look around more so that I find a more familiar something. </p>
<h2>Do some gobuster</h2>
<p>Doing some gobuster reveals <code>\admin</code> . Navigating there you get a pihole admin page. 
Now , where do you find a pihole I wonder. 
I am embarassed that I realised it way later than I was supposed to. </p>
<h3>Realise it runs on raspberrypi</h3>
<h4>Realise it is 'Mirai' botnet, so try default passwords</h4>
<h6>It again took me longer to realise than that it should have</h6>
<p>Just ssh after that and you see a <code>user.txt</code>. cat it and get a user flag. </p>
<p><img alt="alt text" src="/static/assets/mirai_htb_userflag.png" /></p>
<h3>But</h3>
<h4>But</h4>
<h5>But</h5>
<p>You cannot call it a day here, because if you stop now, you won't continue it , ever, so I decided to do the root flag and give myself an excuse to binge entire solo levelling for the 10th time again. </p>
<h2>Find the root flag</h2>
<p>You caveman rawdog the find command with keywords like root, flag</p>
<p>And you find it by </p>
<p><code>sudo find / "*root*" | grep root.txt</code></p>
<p>And you get these </p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>/lib/live/mount/persistence/sda2/root/root.txt
/root/root.txt
</code></pre>

<p>Which one I choose to check out is obvious </p>
<p>But you cannot just read the root.txt, </p>
<p><code>ls: cannot open directory root/: Permission denied</code></p>
<p>I am not proud of the fact my first thought was to look at those Debian version exploits here, some linpeas? </p>
<p>I just had to <code>su -</code> 
(if you didn't realise that instinticively, interesting)</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>root@raspberrypi:~# cat root.txt 
I lost my original root.txt! I think I may have a backup on my USB stick...
</code></pre>

<p>Looks like I will have to explore the other mount point that came out of find command. </p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>root@raspberrypi:/lib/live/mount/persistence/sda2/root# ls
root.txt
root@raspberrypi:/lib/live/mount/persistence/sda2/root# cat root.txt 
I lost my original root.txt! I think I may have a backup on my USB stick...
</code></pre>

<p>well , USB == lsblk </p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>root@raspberrypi:~# lsblk

<p>there is a usbstick </p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>root@raspberrypi:/media/usbstick# ls

Damnit! Sorry man I accidentally deleted your files off the USB stick.
Do you know if there is any way to get them back?

<p>At this point , I turned to some blogs. (uhm chatgpt)
Again, I skimmed so that I don't get the full answer. 
I saw "strings"</p>
<p>I ran the command wherever I thought it was relevant (to me, which is not an objective metric for relevance, nor is a wise way, take a minute or two to think where you should run it and you should have your answer)</p>
